# Unix configuration

This is my collection of configuration scripts for bash, git, etc.

## Install

* Clone into a location (recommend `~/.dotfiles`)
* Run `rake macdev` to bootstrap a Mac OS X system
* Re-run will check for identical files and prompt if a replace will occur.

Replace preserves existing file in `file.orig`
