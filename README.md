# Unix configuration

This is my collection of configuration scripts for bash, zsh, git, etc.

## Install

* Clone into a location (recommend `~/.dotfiles`)
* Run `rake install` to link to home directory. For any files that require input, it will prompt (example - gitconfig)
* Re-run will check for identical files and prompt if a replace will occur. Replace preserves existing file in `file.orig`
